# bc_calculator_clone

## Overview
This is a simple command-line calculator implemented in Perl that follows the DMAS (Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) rules. It supports basic arithmetic operations, including exponentiation.

## Features
- Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^)
- Follows operator precedence (DMAS rule)
- Validates user input to prevent invalid characters
- Provides error handling for incorrect usage

## Requirement
- Perl (Latest Version Recommended)
- Command-line interface (Terminal or Command Prompt)

## Usage
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the script's directory.
2. Run the script using:
    ```bash
    perl bc_calculater_clone.pl
    ```
3. Enter a valid mathematical expression (e.g., `5+3*2^2`).
4. Get the calculated result as output.

## Input

    5+3*2^2
    
## Output

    17

## Error Handling
